##Tutorials

Required files, details on the codebase organization, and examples of how to use this codebase to classify medical images are provided in the Jupyter notebookes __DICOM_crawler.ipynb__, __headCTclassifier.ipynb__, and __walkthrough.ipynb__. We recommend the following order of tutorials to get started:

1. DICOM_crawler.ipynb will demonstrate how to extract pixel data and metadata from a set of DICOM files.
2. headCTclassifier.ipynb will show how to use this codebase to classify a set of medical images stored in a h5 file.
3. walkthrough.ipynb will give an example end-to-end walkthrough on how to use the DICOM crawling and classification pipeline to classify a real dataset, however fewer details are provided than in the two notebooks listed above.
